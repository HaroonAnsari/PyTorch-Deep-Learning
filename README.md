# PyTorch Deep Learning

Welcome to the amazing world of Deep Learning. This repository is useful for anyone who:

  * Is familiar with Deep Learning and want to learn the practical aspects of the same.
  * Is familiar with deep learning, has done practical implementation using a library other than PyTorch and want to learn PyTorch.
  * Is not familiar with Deep Learning and want to learn it by implementing.

Before the implementation of every model, I have provided link to resources from where you can learn the stuff and come back and see how it is implemented in PyTorch.
